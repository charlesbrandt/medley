took some effort, but I think Yapsy is working for plugins for medley now
requested [2012.09.28 07:17:53] 
investigating yapsy
for plugins
as a solution for different collections needing different, custom parsers and scrapers (always)

hg clone http://yapsy.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/yapsy/yapsy

moved in as medley.marks
requested [2012.09.26 08:13:21] 
also considering moving in media_marks.py from podcasts

looks like medley is the best new name for the module

*2012.09.27 19:21:55 
collections conflicts with python.collections module that is part of standard libary
http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html
back to the drawing board here

requested [2012.09.26 08:11:51] 
considering renaming directory to collections
making a collections module out of models.py
could then import those and helpers into other projects

foundation is there...
doesn't do much at this point, but it's a good enough start
requested [2012.09.19 14:04:39] 
merge in original code to new foundation

*2012.09.18 19:01:57
new foundation for a media browser, sorter, tagger application
different from pose
in that it stores meta data locally / separately from the media itself

should be based on:
collections   (these could be labels, studios, etc)
people        (these should be individuals, but might be generalized to bands if no group object)

maybe also:
groups

(similar to subcircuit)

also [2012.09.28 06:33:38] complete
I think it's safe to say that the foundation is complete now
still needs a lot of work, but those can be separate, more specific requests
