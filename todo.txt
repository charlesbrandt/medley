wondering if its possible to abstract presentation aspect more?

considering keeping track of states (maybe use a journal? state.txt?)
many different stages of processing:
-new item
-html converted to json
-downloaded media
-initial bookmarks (either mort player (mpb) or vlc (m3u))
-sync bookmarks with track
-manually tweak/adjust bookmarks with tracks
-pull out plus items
-rank plus items 
-  (consider downloading youtube for plus items? easier to sort that way?)
-push plus items to discogs
-global sort of all items in discogs queue

after looking at applications that leverage mindstream.sources, I'm not sure if I'm ready to move it out... tagger is the one that sticks out...
wouldn't mind moving mindstream/playlists scripts in to medley

cd /c 
find * -type f -name "*.py" -exec /c/templates/scripts/global_find.py mindstream.sources \{\} \;
/c/mindstream/mindstream/sources.py
alpha/sequencer/sequencer.py

from mindstream.sources import Converter, Sources, Source
mindstream/playlist/copy_media.py

from mindstream.sources import Converter, Sources, Source
mindstream/scripts/copy_media.py

from mindstream.sources import Items
mindstream/tagger/tagger.py

from mindstream.sources import Items
yoga/code/quotes/quotes.py
