after looking at applications that leverage mindstream.sources, I'm not sure if I'm ready to move it out... tagger is the one that sticks out...
wouldn't mind moving mindstream/playlists scripts in to medley

cd /c 
find * -type f -name "*.py" -exec /c/templates/scripts/global_find.py mindstream.sources \{\} \;
/c/mindstream/mindstream/sources.py
alpha/sequencer/sequencer.py

from mindstream.sources import Converter, Sources, Source
mindstream/playlist/copy_media.py

from mindstream.sources import Converter, Sources, Source
mindstream/scripts/copy_media.py

from mindstream.sources import Items
mindstream/tagger/tagger.py

from mindstream.sources import Items
yoga/code/quotes/quotes.py

requested [2012.09.18 19:01:57] 
and considering moving in sources from mindstream/mindstream

consider subcircuit code for sources of structures
