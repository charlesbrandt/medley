new foundation for a media browser, sorter, tagger application
different from pose
in that it stores meta data locally / separately from the media itself

should be based on:
collections   (these could be labels, studios, etc)
people        (these should be individuals, but might be generalized to bands if no group object)

maybe also:
groups

(similar to subcircuit)
