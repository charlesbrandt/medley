Installation
====================

The best way to get medley is to clone the mercurial repository:
::

  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/cbrandt/medley
  cd medley
  sudo python setup.py install

Another way to get medley is via easy_install. This version is not always the latest and greatest:
::

  sudo easy_install medley
