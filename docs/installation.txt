Installation
====================

The best way to get moments is to clone the mercurial repository:
::

  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/cbrandt/moments
  cd moments
  sudo python setup.py install

Another way to get moments is via easy_install. This version is not always the latest and greatest:
::

  sudo easy_install moments
