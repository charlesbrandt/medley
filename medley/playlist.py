    Similar to a collection in that it holds a group of Content objects,
    but not geared toward a single source of content.

    Also, not specific to any single playlist format (e.g. M3U).
    
    Because it holds Content objects,
    there is much more meta data available than a typical playlist

    very similar concepts to old mindstream sources module:
    /c/medley/medley/sources.py

    A generic Playlist object
