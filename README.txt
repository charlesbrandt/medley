Medley
==============

I was going to call this package Collections, but that conflicts with the standard library module with the same name.  Medley: "a mixture, especially of heterogeneous elements; hodgepodge; jumble." Close enough!  Welcome to Medley.

Medley helps sort through collections or medleys of content.
