Medley
==============

I was going to call this package Collections, but that conflicts with the standard library module with the same name.  Medley: "a mixture, especially of heterogeneous elements; hodgepodge; jumble." Close enough!  Welcome to Medley.

Medley helps sort through collections or medleys of content.


- Make sure that the media you want to sort is available locally somehow (mount the drive, connect to the shared repository, etc).
Ideally this location is the same on all machines to make playlists compatible.



To generate the documentation, you will need Sphinx:
sudo easy_install sphinx

cd docs/
sphinx-build -b html . ./_build/html/

or
make html

INSTALL
----------
